# To-do list

To-do list in approximate order of importance.

- Add synthetic network generation util
    - Include parameter for entropy? At least for overlap!
    - Include LFR?
    - Include expected degree with min and max k, gamma (random draw)
        - Is it worthwhile to make the precompiled binary now?
- Modify Multiplex to include several Network cores (allows simpler layerwise summaries, like degree sequences, entropy, etc) 
- Add performance util
    - Subgraph of each layer that is correct
